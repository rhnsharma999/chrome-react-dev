# Chrome development setup

This repo is intended to be a basic setup for chrome development. It uses the mono-repo layout and splits the background and the popup scripts separately.

### Background Script

Written in typescript, transpiled to es5.

### Popup

Uses react typescript written from scratch (so no fancy loaders or minifiers are added)

### Build

Uses gulp for building/copying stuff. Located in `chrome-build` package
